# TracerySharp

A (heavily WIP) C# port of [Tracery](http://tracery.io/), a text generation library/language/tool originally designed by [Kate Compton](http://www.galaxykate.com/). Primarily intended to be used within [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) games.

## Installation

You probably shouldn't use this yet! That said, if you *really* want to, you can "install" TracerySharp today by downloading the `Source` directory from this repository and dropping it directly into your Unity project's `Assets` folder.

In the future, I'll be looking into cleaner alternative methods of distributing libraries for use in Unity games.

## Usage

Usage information coming soon.
